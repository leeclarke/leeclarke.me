        <p>I love working on open source software in my free time because it gives me a chance to meet other programmers, sharpen my skills and give soemthing back to the internet community. Some of my current projects are available on Github, others are right here! Hope you find something useful or that teaches you something new!</p>
			<ul class="project-list">
				<li><a href="projects/hRecipeHelper.html">hRecipeHelper</a> - A tool for recipe bloggers, it helps format html for recipes in an hRecipe, microformats style which makes it easy for Googles Recipe View to index and find. </li>
				<li><a href="http://lees2bytes.blogspot.com/2011/02/garden-droid-10.html">The Garden Droid</a> - A web app / Arduino based indoor green house which monitors, reports on and cares for your indoor plants. </li>
