        <p><h2>Aww snap!</h2>Looks like your using IE7 or less. It is really hard to make things work in old versions of IE and I just don't have the energy to wrangle that thing in. I would strongly suggest upgrading to IE8 just for security safety. While your at it, consider trying the new FireFox 4, it's awesome, works with everything and it's secure.</p>
